# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application that creates a webpage that displays a team's basic information so that the manager has quick access to their emails and their GitHub profiles, as well.

## Systems

This application was created using JavaScript, Inquirer, and Node.js, in Visual Studio Code. 

## Application

In the command-line application, the user is prompted for information about the team, including its members. The user is prompted to enter the manager's information (name, employee ID, email address, office number), and then the user is able to add an engineer or an intern to build their team. When either is clicked, the user is prompted to provide their information (name, ID, email, GitHub username). Then, an HTML file is created, and displays a formatted team rosted based on the information the user provided on the command line. If the user clicks on an email address of one of the team members, their default email program opens up and a new email message is created with that email address. When the muser clicks on a GitHub username, the GitHub profile opens in a separate tab.
